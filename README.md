## Features
* **Gulp 4 (alpha) with an ES6 Babel gulpfile**
* **Config file for paths `gulp-config.js`**
* **Uses Yarn instead of Bower+NPM**
* **Uses `gulp-include` directives to bundle all scripts**
* **Relies on binaries from the local project's `./node_modules/bin` instead of globals (except Yarn)**
  * Use with an [`npm` script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) or just [add the local binaries to your PATH](https://github.com/zeke/add-local-binaries-to-path).

These starter files can be used to generate a prototype or flat-file website. The Pug template language is used for the HTML due to its terse structure and integration of JavaScript.

## Requirements:

* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) LTS+
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.org)
  * MacOS: `brew install yarn`
  * Windows: [Get Installer](https://yarnpkg.com/latest.msi)
  * Linux: [Instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#linux-tab)
* [Gulp4](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp#4.0)

## Getting Started

1. Fork and clone repository or download the ZIP file
3. From the terminal inside the project folder, run `yarn`
4. Run `gulp` to build and watch for changes
    * Launches web server with BrowserSync at http://localhost:3000

## Features

### HTML

* [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) template language (formerly Jade) with a nice terse syntax
  * Extend/Include templates, Scripting, Mixins, Interpolation and [more](https://pugjs.org/)
* Starter template based on [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)

### CSS

* [Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass) for writing CSS
  *  Processes through [Autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-autoprefixer) (last 2 browser versions)
  * Includes [normalize.scss](https://github.com/JohnAlbin/normalize-scss) library
  * Includes [modularscale-sass](https://github.com/modularscale/modularscale-sass) library
  * Includes base styles and common global variables
  * Includes [sourcemaps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sourcemaps) to trace errors to the source Sass files

### JavaScript
* Automatically includes and concatenates using [`gulp-include`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-include)
    * jQuery included by default
    * IE Object Fit polyfill included
    * Console log error prevention script included

**JavaScript files are included using `//=require` or `//=include` directives within the script file:**

```JavaScript
//=require plugins/prevent-console-errors.js
//=require ../../../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js
```

* Compresses JS files with [Uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglify)
* No linter—add your own if needed
* [Sourcemaps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sourcemaps) is available but not configured for JavaScript

### Images
* Images placed in `./src/assets/images/` are optimized by default with [imagemin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-imagemin)
  * Place directly in `./dist/assets/images/` if optimization is not needed or undesired


## Templating

The best way to template with [Pug](https://pugjs.org/language/attributes.html), a HAML-like template language, is to extend from a base template. Base templates or partials should be prefixed with an underscore `_` to prevent them from compiling into their own standalone templates. For example:

**Base Template (Simplified): `_base.pug`**

```pug
doctype html
html
block vars
  - var title = 'Fallback Title'
head
  title #{title}
body
  block content
    p Fallback content.
```

**Extended Template: `index.pug`**

```pug
extends _base.pug

block vars
  - var title = 'Hello World'

block content
  h1 Hello World!
  p You've reached my site!
```

**Outputs (Simplified): `index.html`**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>Hello World</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>You've reached my site!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can also include partials with a simple include line:

```pug
header
  include _partials/_hero-slider.pug
```

_For more information, check out the [Pug templating documentation](https://pugjs.orig)._

# Default Setup

By default, the following setup is used:

* Working and Production directories (change in `gulp-config.js`)
    * `src` - Working directory
    * `dist` - Production directory
        * This directory and its subfolders will not be created until the first `gulp` build command
    * `assets` - Assets directory for images, CSS, scripts
    * `templates` - Templates directory for Nunjucks files
* Gulp
    * `gulp` command for default build with BrowserSync preview, also starts watching files
      * Launches web server with BrowserSync at http://localhost:3000
    * `gulp watch` command to watch files for changes
* Pug Templates
    * Build templates in `./src/templates/` using either the `.pug`, or `.jade` extension
    * Name partials and base extends with a leading underscore `_`
    * Builds to `./dist/`
* CSS/SASS
    * Write SCSS or SASS in `./src/assets/sass/`
      * `main.scss` - Import all partials in here
      * `base/` - Base styles
    * Name partials with a leading underscore `_`
    * Concatenates to `./dist/assets/css/main.css`
    * **Note:** Use `yarn add <module> --dev` to maintain SASS libraries and link to them directly
      * Example: `@import '../../../node_modules/modularscale-sass/stylesheets/modularscale';`
* JS
    * User script file in `./src/assets/js/scripts.js` uses gulp-include directives to set bundle order of additional scripts
    * Place additional scripts in `plugins/`
    * **Note:** Use `yarn add <module> --dev` to maintain JS libraries and link to them directly
      * Example: `//=require ../../../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js`
* Images
    * Place images for processing in `./src/assets/images/`
    * Runs imagemin default optimization (change in `gulpfile.babel.js`)
    * Outputs to `./dist/assets/images/`

## Working File Layout

```
./
 └ dist/                # distribution folder
    └ assets
      └ css/      
        └ main.css      # main CSS file
      └ images/   
      └ js/
          └ scripts.js  # bundled scripts
 └ src/                 # working folder
    └ assets
      └ images/         # images to be optimized
      └ js/
          └ scripts.js  # use this for custom scripts
          └ plugins/    # use for non-package.json scripts
      └ scss/
          └ main.scss   # use this to include partials
          └ base/        
              └ _breakpoint-query.scss
              └ _buttons.scss
              └ _normalize.scss
              └ _scaffolding.scss
              └ _typography.scss
              └ _variables.scss
     └ templates/       # use for Pug templates
        └ _base.pug     # base template
        └ index.pug     # index.html, extends _base.pug
```

## Saving New Components

Use the following commands to add modules or libraries to `package.json`. When you clone the repo to a new directory or machine, just run the `yarn add` command. Yarn uses the same repositories as `npm`, and locks the version.

* New project modules/libraries can be added with `yarn add <package-name>`
* New build modules/libraries (such as gulp plugins) can be added with `yarn add <package-name> --dev`
* If you want to shift all packages to their latest versions, you can do `yarn upgrade`. **Do not do this unless you know what you are doing, as it could break your project.**
